  * I am research oriented and spend most of the time on self-learning, especially topics ranging from Data science, programming, AI, ML, DL to environemnetal, political, social
  and economics.
  * Apart from Data Science I love to travel and do travel photography. Being a nature lover I mostly shoot beautiful landscapes and occasionally a few cityscapes. You can have a 
  look at my pictures on my Instagram @von.jk
